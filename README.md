## Description

This application presents Claire with a home page where she is presented with a link to a list of clients, and a link to a list of stylists. Claire can navigate to the list of stylists, and add new stylists to the list by their name and information. Each stylist will have information about their specialties, which can be viewed by selecting a specific stylist from the list.

Once a stylist has been added to the list, users can then navigate to the client list. There, they can add new clients to a specific stylist. **Note: At least one stylist must be added before a client can be added.** Claire can also select a client, and view which stylist they see. Claire also has the option to edit and delete clients and stylists.
